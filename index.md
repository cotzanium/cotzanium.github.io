Hi, Iâ€™m Chris. I am an [Electrical Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriszumbika) by qualification but I consider myself a Software Engineer who loves data analytics, electronics and [photography](https://www.500px.com/cotzanium).

I have a diverse set of skills ranging from software engineering, data analytics, reporting, server administration to electronics. You can visit my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriszumbika) profile for more information.

When im not volunteering; I enjoy hiking, camping, [playing with my camera](https://www.500px.com/cotzanium) and trying out new things.
